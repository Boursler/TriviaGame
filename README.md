# TriviaGame
This is a simple Trivia Game coded in JavaScript. To play the game, simply hit the "Start" button. Timers will move the game from one question to another, showing you a new question each in turn. At the end fo the game, you will have the option to restart the experience. 

The theme is Existentialist writing. Let's experience existentialistm together, here and now (there is no other time, there is no other place)!

HTML for the game is found in index.html at the top level directory. Game logic is located in the assets/javascript/ directory. 

Users run the app in their browser. Once the game starts, each question and answer section run on a timer. The game is reset using a button at endgame.
